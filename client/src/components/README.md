# Components

Components are the basic building blocks of react and we should build them up block by block.

The file structure should be as follows:

- (Folder) `ComponentName`
  - `ComponentName.tsx`
  - `ComponentName.story.tsx`
  - `ComponentName.test.tsx` (optional)
    - (Folder) `ChildComponent` (optional)
      - Follows same structure as above
